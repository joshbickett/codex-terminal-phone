# Codex Terminal Phone Setup

- Launch a free GCP `e2-micro` Compute Engine VM and grab its external IP.
- Install Termius on iOS, add the VM as a host (username, SSH key, IP), and save.
- Open the new host in Termius to SSH into the GCP instance.
- Inside the VM, download and install the Codex CLI.
- Happy coding!
